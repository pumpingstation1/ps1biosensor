# What's this?

This is a Python program that provides a web interface (at http://localhost:8888/) that will show traces from the PS:1 Biosensor project. You'll need:

* pyserial
* tornado (1.2 suggested)
* python 2.6 or higher (suggested, previous versions untested)
* an arduino burned with the PS:1 biosensor array firmware
